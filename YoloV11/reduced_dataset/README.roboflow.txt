The dataset includes 4301 images.
Holds are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
